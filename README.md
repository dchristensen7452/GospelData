# GospelData
The Gospel Data project is part of my ongoing investigation of the Synoptic Gospels and their literary relationship. 

This website is, in one instance, my final project for DIGS 30005 - Data Publication, where I display my knowledge and implementation of resources for digital publication such as, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, XML, and XSL. 

In another, it serves as a sort of "digital appendix" to my Master's Thesis at the University of Chicago entitled "Gospel Data: Operationalizing Exegesis through Empirical Analysis of the Synoptic Gospels." In this regard I hope to use this website to display my notes on the Synoptic texts and highlight the ways in which they can be analyzed. 

Lastly, I hope this website will become a resource for others who study to Synoptic Gospels. To this end I envision it as a starting point for discussion on how these texts can be analyzed in new ways, and what questions can be investigated when engaging with the texts in a digital medium.
